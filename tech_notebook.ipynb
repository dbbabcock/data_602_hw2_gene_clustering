    "If gene expression data can be clustered meaningfully based on levels and the resulting clusters match groups of samples from certain types of tumors, then it would be worthwhile to continue gathering data on gene expression levels and focusing on those genes or groups of genes that seem to be expressed at high levels.\n",

    "It is possible that, with those genes inactivated, cancer patients might see improvements in their symptoms or we might be able to prevent the tumor from forming to begin with if caught early enough in the process.\n",

    "\n",
    "I would start by clustering based off of samples and seeing if the resulting clusters corresponded to the types of tumors the samples are associated with. If the clusters seem to match up with the types of tumors, then it would be a good sign that there are commonalities in gene expression levels that can potentially be exploited to develop new tests/treatments for different kinds of tumors.\n",

    "After that, I attempted to group the genes together into 'families' of sorts that might act in unison to form/grow the various tumors. If there are distinct clusters amongst the genes, then it might be worthwile to look into these specific groupings as targets for pharmaceutical research."
